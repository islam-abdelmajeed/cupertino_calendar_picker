/// Displays a Cupertino-style calendar picker as an overlay above or below the widget.
///
/// The picker allows users to select a date or a date-time depending on the specified mode.
/// It can be positioned relative to the [widgetRenderBox] and supports customizations
/// such as spacing, color, and decorations.
///
/// The method returns a [Future] that resolves to a [DateTime] if a date was selected,
/// or `null` if the picker was dismissed without a selection.
///
/// ## Parameters:
///
/// - [context]:
///   The build context in which the picker will be displayed. This is required to show
///   the overlay.
///
/// - [widgetRenderBox]:
///   The render box of the widget relative to which the calendar picker is displayed.
///   This is required to correctly position the picker. If `null`, the picker
///   might not display correctly.
///
/// - [minimumDateTime]:
///   The earliest selectable [DateTime] in the picker.
///
/// - [maximumDateTime]:
///   The latest selectable [DateTime] in the picker.
///   Must be after or equal to [minimumDateTime].
///
/// - [onDateTimeChanged]:
///   A callback that is triggered whenever the selected [DateTime] changes in the picker.
///
/// - [onDateSelected]:
///   A callback that is triggered when a date is selected by the user. This is useful
///   for handling the final date selection action.
///
/// - [initialDateTime]:
///   The initially selected [DateTime] that the calendar should display when it opens.
///   This must be between [minimumDateTime] and [maximumDateTime], or equal to one of them.
///   If not provided, the calendar will default to `DateTime.now()`.
///
/// - [currentDateTime]:
///   The [DateTime] representing the current day (i.e., today). It will be highlighted
///   in the day grid. If `null`, `DateTime.now()` will be used.
///
/// - [onDisplayedMonthChanged]:
///   A callback that is triggered when the user navigates to a different month in the picker.
///   Useful for tracking the month being displayed.
///
/// - [horizontalSpacing]:
///   The horizontal spacing between the picker and the edges of the screen.
///   Default is [15.0] pixels.
///
/// - [verticalSpacing]:
///   The vertical spacing between the picker and the edges of the screen.
///   Default is [15.0] pixels.
///
/// - [offset]:
///   The offset from the top/bottom of the [widgetRenderBox] location.
///   Default is `Offset(0.0, 10.0)`.
///
/// - [barrierColor]:
///   The color of the barrier that darkens the rest of the screen when
///   the picker is displayed.
///   Default is [Colors.transparent], meaning no darkening occurs.
///
/// - [mainColor]:
///   The primary color used in the calendar picker, typically for highlighting
///   the selected date and other important elements.
///   Default is [CupertinoColors.systemRed].
///
/// - [dismissBehavior]:
///   Determines how the calendar can be dismissed. The default value is
///   [CalendarDismissBehavior.onOutsideTap], allowing dismissal by tapping
///   outside the calendar.
///   The Android back button will always close the calendar.
///
/// - [containerDecoration]:
///   Optional custom decoration for the picker container.
///
/// - [weekdayDecoration]:
///   Optional custom decoration for the weekdays' row in the calendar.
///
/// - [monthPickerDecoration]:
///   Optional custom decoration for the month picker view.
///
/// - [headerDecoration]:
///   Optional custom decoration for the header of the picker.
///
/// - [footerDecoration]:
///   Optional custom decoration for the footer of the picker.
///   Applied for the [dateTime] mode only.
///
/// - [mode]:
///   The mode in which the picker operates. Default is [CupertinoCalendarMode.date].
///   If [CupertinoCalendarMode.dateTime] is used, the picker will also
///   allow selecting time.
///
/// - [timeLabel]:
///   An optional label to be displayed when the calendar is in a mode that includes time selection.
///   [CupertinoCalendarMode.dateTime] mode.
///   This label typically indicates what the selected time is for or provides
///   additional context.
///
/// - [minuteInterval]:
///   The interval of minutes that the time picker should allow, applicable only in
///   [CupertinoCalendarMode.dateTime] mode.
///   The default value is 1 minute, meaning the user can select any minute of the hour.
///
/// - [use24hFormat]:
///   For 24h format being used or not, results in AM/PM being shown or hidden in the widget.
///   Setting to `true` or `false` will force 24h format to be on or off.
///   The default value is null, which calls [MediaQuery.alwaysUse24HourFormatOf].
///
/// ## Returns:
///
/// A [Future] that resolves to the selected [DateTime] if a date was chosen, or `null`
/// if the picker was dismissed without a selection.
